## Utilizing Quantitative Data in Religious Therapy Associations

**Date:** March 31, 2025  
**Time:** 3-5pm (GMT)  
**Moderators:** Stephen Christopher and David Johnson

### Workshop Overview

The aim of this workshop is to integrate the experiential knowledge (and therapeutic gaps) of spiritual therapists from varied backgrounds into the questions that will constitute the New Religiosities Poll. These associations are on the global front line of making psychological data about well-being actionable for specific religious communities.

Through a lightly moderated discussion about values, gender, health and finances, we will strive to find commonalities between data useful for religious therapists and scholars of religion alike. In Year 3, we will have a follow-up workshop to share preliminary project findings.
